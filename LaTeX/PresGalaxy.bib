abstract = {The basic framework for a successful theory of large-scale structure is provided by the cold dark matter hypothesis. It works surprisingly well, and has led to predictions, such as the clustering of gas and galaxies as a function of redshift, that have been observationally tested. However, with regard to galaxy formation, the model has made limited progress. Attempts have been made to incorporate analytical parametrisations of star formation and gas cooling into the numerical simulations. While these so-called semi-analytical models have had some success, little more emerges from the models than is inserted. A robust testing of parameters is not feasible. Star formation is a complex process that is poorly understood in our local vicinity. It is not surprising that we have failed to develop a satisfactory model of star formation in protogalaxies, where conditions are likely to be very different from those at the current epoch. Modelling of galaxy formation must include the complexities of star formation in a multiphase interstellar medium, well beyond the reach of current three-dimensional formulations, and incorporate the astrophysical uncertainties of stellar feedback processes as well as the physical uncertainties of compressible and possibly, magnetohydrodynamical, turbulence.}

    abstract = {The morphological properties of galaxies in the range 21 \&lt; I \&lt; 25 mag in the Hubble Deep Field are investigated using a quantitative classification system based on measurements of the central concentration and asymmetry of galaxian light. The class distribution of objects in the Hubble Deep Field is strongly skewed towards highly asymmetric objects, relative to distributions from both the HST Medium Deep Survey at I\&lt;22 mag and an artificially redshifted sample of local galaxies. The steeply rising number count-magnitude relation for irregular/peculiar/merging systems at I \&lt; 22 mag reported by Glazebrook et al. continues to at least I = 25 mag. Although these peculiar systems are predominantly blue at optical wavelengths, a significant fraction also exhibit red U–B colours, which may indicate that they are at high redshift. Beyond Glazebrook et al.'s magnitude limit, the spiral counts appear to rise more steeply than high-normalization no-evolution predictions, whereas those of elliptical/S0 galaxies only slightly exceed such predictions and may turn over beyond I ∼ 24 mag. These results are compared with those from previous investigations of faint galaxy morphology with HST, and the possible implications are briefly discussed. The large fraction of peculiar/irregular/merging systems in the Hubble Deep Field suggests that by I ∼ 25 mag the conventional Hubble system no longer provides an adequate description of the morphological characteristics of a high fraction of field galaxies.},
